                                        Lyft pioneered ride-sharing, saving
                                        money and reducing emissions. Its
                                        thorough driver background checks
                                        prioritize passenger safety, going
                                        beyond star ratings.

                            I began this project with the assumption that people
                            primarily use Bolt for its affordability and easy
                            access to remote areas. However, through my
                            research, particularly in my locality (Nigeria), I
                            discovered that many users prioritize comfort when
                            choosing mobility services like Bolt. <br /><br />

                            They are willing to pay the extra price per ride for
                            the experience of being in control.
