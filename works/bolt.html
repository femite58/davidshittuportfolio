            <div class="content">
                Bolt is the first European super-app, aiming to make urban
                mobility more affordable, safe, and sustainable. Their mission
                is to help people save time, money, reduce stress, and enhance
                cities, while empowering millions of entrepreneurs such as
                drivers, couriers, restaurant owners, and store owners.<br /><br />

                Bolt embodies the essence of freedom of movement and strongly
                believes that cars should be accessible to all at a low price.
                However, the fluctuation in ride prices can be discouraging for
                those with limited financial means. Bolt's pricing model, which
                changes based on traffic and time, often fails to provide
                customers with sufficient prior information. This contradicts
                their mission of saving money and making transportation
                affordable. Customers can find it frustrating when the price
                increases after booking a car, as they may not have enough funds
                to cover the updated cost. The delayed information leads to a
                poor user experience.

                        than initially anticipated. This can pose a significant
                        problem if the user does not have sufficient funds to
                        cover the increased cost.

                    Based on my research on user reviews from the Google Play
                    Store, only a few people reported having a positive
                    experience with the app, while many users encountered
                    multiple issues. However, one common and consistent problem
                    emerged: the price changing after reaching the destination
                    due to surges or peak times. This dynamic frustrated users
                    and led to numerous complaints.<br /><br />

                    Furthermore, users expressed dissatisfaction with the
                    quality of driver services, with one individual stating that
                    drivers should receive orientation before being allowed to
                    pick up customers. Although a star rating system exists, it
                    does not necessarily determine which drivers are suggested
                    to users.

                        I downloaded both the Bolt and Uber apps to assess their
                        user experience and overall feel. <br />However, I was
                        unable to download the Lyft app as it is not available
                        in my country. Therefore, my research on Lyft was based
                        on secondary sources such as websites and user reviews.
                        In order to differentiate themselves and embody their
                        respective goals, competitors often introduce unique
                        features that set them apart.

                            Competitors in the ride-hailing industry have
                            specific goals that are reflected in their
                            distinctive features. Bolt aims to provide
                            affordable ride prices, catering to customers across
                            various income ranges, which contributes to their
                            growing market share, particularly in countries like
                            the US.<br /><br />

                            Uber, on the other hand, focuses on affordability
                            through features like ride-sharing, initially
                            introduced by Lyft. This reduces ride costs and
                            helps lower the carbon footprint by optimizing
                            vehicle usage. Uber's commitment to sustainability
                            is further emphasized by allowing multiple
                            drop-offs, offering users a range of convenient
                            options.<br /><br />

                            Lyft pioneered the concept of ride-sharing, bridging
                            the gap between public transportation and private
                            cars. This approach saves money and reduces carbon
                            emissions by reducing the number of vehicles on the
                            road. Lyft's comprehensive background checks for
                            drivers contribute to passenger safety, addressing
                            concerns such as incidents of driver misuse. Driver
                            selection is not solely based on star ratings but
                            also incorporates thorough background checks.

                            etc. This enables them to maximize their profit.
                            However, the time when the price is revealed to you
                            differs. Uber and Lyft tell you their price before

                                Bolt and other mobility service providers use a
                                pricing system known as Dynamic or Surge
                                pricing.<br /><br />

                                Dynamic pricing is a pricing strategy that
                                allows firms to modify product prices in
                                response to changing demand. The pricing
                                strategy is aimed at getting the best price for
                                a particular product or service in response to
                                changing factors. This pricing methodology is
                                adopted by several industries, such as event
                                ticketing, hospitality, real estate, and
                                transportation.<br /><br />

                                Bolt and other mobility services give prices
                                based on several variables like traffic
                                patterns, weather conditions, time, competitor
                                prices, distance, and demand.

                            <div class="content">
                                Dynamic or surge pricing provides a fairly
                                accurate method of setting prices for their ride
                                as a number of variables such as traffic and
                                demand are not predictable. <br /><br />

                                Removing dynamic or surge pricing without having
                                an accurate system of predicting prices would
                                put the company and drivers at a disadvantage.
                                Variables like traffic and demand are
                                unpredictable, and dynamic pricing provides a
                                fair method of setting prices. Without it, the
                                company may experience losses if variables
                                change during the ride, and rides could be
                                overpriced, potentially leading riders to switch
                                to competitors.<br /><br />

                                I firmly believe that dynamic pricing should
                                continue to be utilized as AI and other
                                prediction systems used for pricing variables
                                are often not entirely accurate.

                                The research findings indicate that Bolt informs
                                their customers about price changes after the
                                ride, which leads to a feeling of being deceived
                                among customers. The issue is not solely about
                                paying an additional amount, but rather the
                                change from the agreed-upon price. <br /><br />

                                Consistency is valued by users, and discovering
                                the price change after the ride worsens the
                                overall experience. <br /><br />

                                Uber solved this by providing upfront pricing
                                before the ride, which is beneficial in terms of
                                transparency. However, it can result in losses
                                for the company if there are changes in the
                                variables during the ride that affect the cost.

                                price. This ensures transparency and provides
                                riders with an understanding of the reasons

                I began this project with the assumption that people primarily
                use Bolt for its affordability and easy access to remote areas.
                However, through my research, particularly in my locality
                (Nigeria), I discovered that many users prioritize comfort when
                choosing mobility services like Bolt. <br /><br />

                They are willing to pay the extra price per ride for the
                experience of being in control. <br /><br />

                I believe that these little adjustments will increase Bolt's
                market share tremendously and boost revenue.
