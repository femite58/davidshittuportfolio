                freelancers consolidate and control all their subscriptions in
                one account using virtual credit cards, and buy new
                subscriptions at substantial discounts. NachoNacho is also a new

                As part of the team, I contributed to the redesign of the SaaS
                app. This involved conducting extensive research to identify
                bottlenecks hindering growth and creating designs to enhance
                both the functionality and aesthetics of the app, thereby
                driving its overall growth. <br /><br />

                I worked with the lead designer, marketing lead and engineering
                team to improve the user experience of the app.

                        process that was integrated into the sign-up process.
                        Consequently, this resulted in high churn rates among

                The challenge with the lengthy KYC/KYB process arose from the
                mandatory information requirements required by our bank partner.
                This means that we need to get all mandatory information while
                making the process seamless and less cumbersome.

                        We streamlined the onboarding process by separating the
                        KYC/KYB verification from the sign-up process, ensuring
                        users are onboarded onto the app before requesting
                        identity verification.

                    <li>
                        We redesigned the process to be more intuitive,

                        out the form.

                Users were given the opportunity to explore and familiarize

                verification. This reduces friction during the onboarding
                process, making it more user-friendly and accommodating. By
                giving users a chance to experience the app's features and
                functionality, they can develop a better understanding of its
                value proposition, which may increase their motivation to
                complete the verification process.
