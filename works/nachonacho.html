                                As a product designer at NachoNacho, I worked
                                closely with a cross-functional team to design
                                an experience that advances our business goals.
                                This include product adoption, conversion, user
                                satisfaction, and engagement. <br /><br />
                                I've worked on many successful features, but for
                                this case study, I'll focus on how we increased
                                our conversion rate in our KYC process and drove
                                adoption of NachoCard, our virtual debit card.

                                        We streamlined the onboarding process by
                                        separating the KYC/KYB verification from
                                        the sign-up process, ensuring users are
                                        onboarded onto the app before requesting
                                        identity verification.

                                This makes onboarding smoother and friendlier.
                                By letting users try out the app first, they can
                                see its value, which might make them more

                                navigating through multiple pages. <br /><br />
                                I redesigned the NachoCard creation process into
                                a single-page form, simplifying it and reducing
                                friction. This change increased completion time
                                and made it easier for users to spot and correct
