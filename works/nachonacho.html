                        <br /><br />

                        NachoNacho is a B2B SaaS application that helps
                        businesses and freelancers consolidate and control all
                        their subscriptions in one account using virtual credit
                        cards, and buy new subscriptions at substantial
                        discounts. NachoNacho is also a new user acquisition
                        channel for SaaS vendors through their marketplace.

                        As part of the team, I contributed to the redesign of
                        the SaaS app. This involved conducting extensive
                        research to identify bottlenecks hindering growth and
                        creating designs to enhance both the functionality and
                        aesthetics of the app, thereby driving its overall
                        growth. <br /><br />

                        I worked with the lead designer, marketing lead and
                        engineering team to improve the user experience of the
                        app.

                                Onboarding users posed a problem due to a
                                lengthy Know Your Customer/Know Your Business
                                (KYC/KYB) verification process that was
                                integrated into the sign-up process.
                                Consequently, this resulted in high churn rates
                                among potential users.

                        The challenge with the lengthy KYC/KYB process arose

                        our bank partner. This means that we need to get all

                                We streamlined the onboarding process by
                                separating the KYC/KYB verification from the
                                sign-up process, ensuring users are onboarded
                                onto the app before requesting identity
                                verification.

                        during the onboarding process, making it more
                        user-friendly and accommodating. By giving users a
                        chance to experience the app's features and
                        functionality, they can develop a better understanding
                        of its value proposition, which may increase their

                        After implementing our redesign, we witnessed a
                        significant and remarkable surge in overall product
                        engagement and usage, two crucial key performance
                        indicators (KPIs) that we closely monitored. The
                        positive impact of the changes was evident in the
                        enhanced user experience, increased customer
                        satisfaction, and improved business outcomes. Our
                        efforts to create a more intuitive and user-friendly
                        interface resulted in a boost to the product's adoption
                        and usage, driving us closer to achieving our strategic
                        objectives and delighting our users.
