                Increst is an online investment platform that enables users to
                invest in the stock market from anywhere. It is specifically
                designed to cater to beginners and newbies, providing

                A stock is a financial instrument that represents ownership of a
                portion of the issuing corporation. Shares are units of stock
                that entitle the owner to a proportion of the corporation's
                profits and assets equal to the amount of stock they own. Stocks
                can be an important component of your investment portfolio.
                Investing in various companies can help you build your savings,
                protect your money from inflation and taxes, and maximize your
                return on investment.

                        The survey results indicate that there exists a
                        significant knowledge deficit among individuals when it
                        comes to stock investing and overall understanding of
                        the subject. Despite a notable level of awareness about
                        stocks, as reported by nine in ten participants, the
                        majority of respondents lack the necessary knowledge and
                        understanding required to confidently navigate the stock
                        market and make informed investment decisions.
                        <br /><br />

                        This knowledge deficit suggests that there is a gap
                        between the interest or willingness to invest in stocks
                        and the actual knowledge required to do so effectively.
                        Many individuals may have a desire to explore stock
                        investing as a means of wealth creation or financial
                        growth, but they may be deterred by the complexities and
                        uncertainties associated with the stock market.

                    During the 2019 Covid-19 pandemic, online learning
                    experienced a significant surge as people were required to
                    stay locked down. According to Bay Atlantic University -
                    Washington (2019), 60% of online students reported that
                    their online education helped them improve soft skills, with
                    problem solving skills being cited most frequently (85%).
                    The impact of online courses on skill development is
                    undeniable, as I myself can attest to. Despite being a
                    microbiology graduate, I have been able to transition into a
                    career as a product designer through online learning
                    opportunities. <br /><br />

                    Building upon this understanding, we have developed simple
                    and concise short courses that allow users to grasp the
                    basics of the stock market and effectively navigate through
                    our app. These courses aim to equip users with the necessary
                    knowledge and skills to confidently engage in stock market
                    investing, regardless of their educational background.
                    <br /><br />

                    By leveraging the power of online learning, we strive to
                    empower individuals with the tools they need to participate
                    in the stock market and make informed investment decisions.

                    To address the challenge of completing courses, we have
                    introduced educational games alongside our short courses.
                    These games are designed to teach users about stocks in a
                    fun and interactive way. This approach is inspired by
                    successful platforms like Duolingo, which use games to
                    facilitate language learning. <br /><br />

                    Our games provide an enjoyable and immersive experience
                    where users can learn about key stock market concepts and
                    make informed decisions while purchasing stocks. By
                    incorporating gamification into our educational strategy, we
                    aim to make the learning process more engaging and
                    accessible for users. <br /><br />

                    With this combination of short courses and interactive

                    knowledge and skills needed to navigate the stock market
