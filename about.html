                I am David Shittu, a Product Designer and UX Researcher based in
                Lagos, Nigeria
                <img src="assets/images/about/ng.png" alt="Nigeria" />
                <br /><br />

                I love creating simple, awesome digital products that push the
                boundaries of innovation while maintaining usability and
                usefulness. My approach to design is rooted in informed
                decision-making, drawing insights from thorough research,
                whether primary or secondary. I place a strong emphasis on
                creating designs that are inclusive and accessible to all. I
                believe in the power of first principle thinking. <br /><br />

                I currently work as a freelance designer at This is Garcy design
                studio, where I collaborate with clients from around the world.

                />
                <br />

                I am not your typical nerd, but I definitely have a touch of
                geekiness. With a keen interest in technology and a love for
                learning, I embrace my inner nerd while still maintaining a cool
                and social demeanor. I effortlessly blend in with different
                social groups, bringing my own unique mix of intelligence,
                humor, and style to any situation. I am the perfect balance of
                geek and charm üòúü´†

                During my free time, you will often find me immersed in various
                activities such as watching YouTube and movies, playing the
                keyboard, and studying my Bible. <br /><br />
