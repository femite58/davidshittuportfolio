                        Hi, Iâ€™m David and I am passionately curious.
                        <br /><br />

                        When I was 12, I discovered
                        <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle"
                            target="_blank"
                            >Einstein's Puzzle</a
                        >
                        while sneaking my mom's phone and solved it in one
                        night, intrigued by the claim that only 20% of the world
                        could solve it. Although I later found out the claim was
                        incorrect, the joy of solving it ignited a lifelong path
                        of curiosity within me. <br /><br />

                        I have destroyed and repaired a number of electronics as
                        a child. This drive to understand how things work has
                        guided me on my journey in design, where I continually
                        strive to discover the mechanisms behind how things
                        work. <br /><br />

                        <b
                            >I am a strong advocate for accessibility in
                            design.</b
                        >
                        <br /><br />

                        During my free time, you will find me watching YouTube
                        videos, movies, listening to podcasts or playing the
                        keyboard. The Big Bang Theory is my favorite TV show and
                        I have seen the entire 12 seasons at least 5 times.
