                        I am David Shittu, a Product Designer and UX Researcher
                        based in Lagos, Nigeria
                        <img src="assets/images/about/ng.png" alt="Nigeria" />
                        <br /><br />
                        I create simple, awesome digital products that push the
                        boundaries of innovation while maintaining usability and
                        usefulness. My work as a product designer has driven
                        significant transformations in user acquisition and
                        feature adoption for businesses. I'm right there with
                        you at every stage of the design process. <br /><br />

                        I am particularly interested innovative technologies in
                        SaaS, Mobile, wearables, design systems, assistive
                        technology, car interface design/experience, and virtual
                        and mixed reality. <br /><br />

                        I currently work as a freelance designer at This is
                        Garcy design studio, where I collaborate with clients
                        from around the world.

                        <br />

                        I am not your typical nerd, but I definitely have a
                        touch of geekiness. With a keen interest in technology
                        and a love for learning, I embrace my inner nerd while
                        still maintaining a cool and social demeanor. I
                        effortlessly blend in with different social groups,
                        bringing my own unique mix of intelligence, humor, and
                        style to any situation. I am the perfect balance of geek
                        and charm üòúü´† <br /><br />
